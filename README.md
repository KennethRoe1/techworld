Semester 2 Team Project, developing an online Electronic Store using a Java based backend connecting to a MySQL server. HTML/CSS/JQuery is used in the frontend.

## Instructions

The Backend Eclipse project is available in the *backend* folder under root. All client resources including all HTML, CSS, Javascript files and images are available in the *frontend* folder; there is no eclipse project associated with the *frontend* folder. If importing into a **Dynamic Web Project** in eclipse ensure that the contents of the *frontend* folder are present in the *WebContent* folder within the Eclipse project.
